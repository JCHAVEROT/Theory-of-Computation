# Theory of Computation problems and solutions

Problems within fields of automata theory, computability theory, NP-completeness.

These homeworks were conducted within the framework of the Theory of Computation ([CS-251](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/theory-of-computation-CS-251)) course at EPFL.

I do not claim that the solutions we provided are correct nor exhaustive. Please refer to the instructor's ones.
